Computational Analysis of Action Potential Initiation in Mitral
Cell Soma and Dendrites Based on Dual Patch Recordings.

Questions about how to use this simulation should be

Running the model (execution of the mosinit.hoc file) will display
the data and simulation results as in  Fig 3 and 5.

The cell2 subdirectory contains cell data and simulation which shows
only a limited decrease in the action potential interval.
Running the model (cd cell2 and execute the mosinit.hoc file)
will display the data and simulation within a Multiple Run Fitter.
