This is the readme for a version of the matlab code used to implement
the model of the olfactory bulb developed in the paper:

Polese D, Martinelli E, Marco S, Di Natale C, Gutierrez-Galvez A
(2014) Understanding Odor Information Segregation in the Olfactory
Bulb by Means of Mitral and Tufted Cells.  PLoS ONE 9(10):
e109716. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109716

Please cite this paper if you publish any research results obtained
with this code or any modified versions of this code.

This simple model of olfactory bulb model is composed of 4 neuron
types: Mitral Cell, Tufted Cell, PeriGlomerular Cell and Short Axon
Cell.
The different neurons are obtained changing the object properties of
the NeuronIzh matlab class (NeuronIzh.m). The neurons are connected to
build a glomerulus using the methods of the class glomerulus
(glomerulus.m).

The file test.m can be used to try the software and obtain the results
behind the example.png which is representative of the paper figure 2C:

<img src="./example.png" alt="example" width="550">

Graph simply after running the model with commands like

plot(0.1*[1:5000], Out_M1v(1:2:end,:)');

If you are impatient instead of running the model (takes 10 minutes or
so) you can just type on the command line

load Results.mat

and then run the above graphing command.
