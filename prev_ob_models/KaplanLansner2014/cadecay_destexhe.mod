TITLE Fast mechanism for submembranal Ca++ concentration (cai)
:
: Takes into account:
:
:	- increase of cai due to calcium currents
:	- extrusion of calcium with a simple first order equation
:
: This mechanism is compatible with the calcium pump "cad" and has the 
: same name and parameters; however the parameters specific to the pump
: are dummy here.
:
: Parameters:
:
:	- depth: depth of the shell just beneath the membran (in um)
:	- cainf: equilibrium concentration of calcium (2e-4 mM)
:	- taur: time constant of calcium extrusion (must be fast)
:	- kt,kd: dummy parameters
