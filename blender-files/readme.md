Files in this folder were developed using Blender v2.79. For best results, open them with that version.

**Most Important File**
 - `ob-gloms-fast.blend` The locations of all possible glomeruli and cell somas of the network model. 
 Model slices select a subset of these cells and glomeruli. Includes simplified layer meshes, which are
 used for cell orientation, and mitral cell lateral dendrite alignment.

**Other Files**
 - `10MC-net.blend` Displays a static 10 MC network used to create a video for the PhD defense
 - `bulb-layers-only.blend` Animation of nested OB layer structure. Uploaded to [Sketchfab](https://skfb.ly/6NpHL)
 - `cell-galery.blend` Used to create a figure of all three types of cells side-by-side and from top-down
 - `cell-galery-animated.blend` Animation of AP propagation of side-by-side cells. Used in PhD defense presentation. 
 - `gloms-aligned-with-Mig14.blend` Registers the locations of glomeruli in Migliore 2014 model to the locations of glomeruli in this model.
 - `layers-simplified.blend` Simplified meshes of all OB layers. 
 - `ob-all-cells.blend.tar.gz` Non-simplified layer meshes with full set of cell locations.
 - `ob-gloms.blend.tar.gz` Non-simplified layers with glomerular locations.
