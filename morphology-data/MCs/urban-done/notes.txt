WHAT I DID: 
i manually fixed these by moving the tuf to the end of the apical dendrite
some dendites technically started as apical but then behaved like lateral (e.g. to the side along the EPL). I reclassified those branches as lateral dendrites

these appear to be relatively thin slices with one edge of the slice right next to the soma

height and width seems to be ok, but depth is not right
