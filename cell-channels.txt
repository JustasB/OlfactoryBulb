ok so now i have the scores of all the models, including models with the lowest score

the results here are a major section of the project: which of the existing models most closelly model the experimental data?

to present this section, i would want:
	-table with all the exp data, model scores, z scores and total score per model (as supplementary table)
		-sorted by the model score
		-the same table should contain our model, with the goal of showing a better score
	-the traces of the best previous model - a figure arranged
	-traces of my best fitted model - either same or another figure, for comparison

could make the above during the fitting process

diam, L control input resistance, rheobase
Cm controls time constant and delay to first spike and FI slope
g_pass or gl_hh controls input resistance and resting v slightly

e_pass affects the resting potentialsom
el_hh controls resting potential strongly

ena controls fi slope, spike height
ek resting potential, rheobase, spontaneus firing

gnabar_hh rheobase, fi slope, spont firing, spike height

gkbar_hh rheobnase, resting potnetial, AHP
	-if too small, AP will not AHP

what wee need is to set up a pipeline where params are set, and then tests are run, score computed
	i think the primary issue is WHICH params to vary? which channels to include FIRST? what are the ranges of the params

	probably channels from the closest cells can be reused
	
	can look at papers that report wierd features like sags and rebound spikes and isi variabily

	the other issue is channel distribution - soma, apical, lateral


sag, - caused by Ih - ih is expressed in apical dendrites in the glom (angelo 2012) - but varies from glom to glom, but same for sister MCs
isicv - high CV cells had no sag. Sag/ih seems to regullarize firing - YES

stuttering can be caused by iA channels (rush rinzel, a type of bursting)

rebound - mcs dont have rebounds, but shown to have LVA T-type Ca channels in apical dendrite (Johnson delaney)
		lack of rebounds may indicate additional I-A channels - they stop "anodal breaks" (rush rinzel 95)
		
		but rebounds are present in TCs which also stutter
		maybe lva ca overcome the ia rebound inhibition?

ahp duration - stronger potassium channels 

fi slope/gain is probably due to k channels too

spike accommodation - slow k channels
