This is a simulation of the electrical responses of three classes of
granule cells of the olfactory bulb to synaptic inputs

Start GENESIS simulator. 
On the command line type:
Frontiers_granI.g =>to start the type I granule cell.
Frontiers_granII.g =>to start the type II granule cell.
Frontiers_granIII.g =>to start the type III granule cell.

For Frontiers_gran(#).g you will see four panels: 
Panel 1: Control panel
Panel 2: NMDA and AMPA receptor conductances in the stimulated spine 
Panel 3: Membrane potential in the soma and dendritic trunk 
Panel 4: full representation of the cell

On the panel 1, click on the STIM button to start a simulation that
stimulates the AMPA and NMDA receptors in the spines of the tip of the
apical dendrites. You can also just inject a current in the soma by
changing the Injection value (for instance 1e-10) and clicking on the
RUN button. dt stands for the simulation time step, and Tmax stands
for the maximum simulation time.


On the panel 4, type the "<" and ">" keys to zoom out and in, and use
the arrows to move the cell around. Use the key "p" to see the cell in
perspective. Pseudocolor code represents the membrane potential of the
compartments. "Hot" colors mean depolarization and "Cold" colors mean
hyperpolarization.
