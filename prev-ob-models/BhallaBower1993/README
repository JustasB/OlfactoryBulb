This is a conversion to NEURON of the mitral cell model described in: 

Bhalla US and Bower JM. (1993) Exploring parameter space in detailed single
neuron models: simulations of the mitral and granule cells of the olfactory bulb. 
J. Neurophysiol. 69:1948-1965. 

The original model was written in GENESIS and is available from:
http://www.bbb.caltech.edu/BABEL/babeldirs/cells/mitral_granule/

Running the model (by executing mosinit.hoc) runs a simulation comparable
to Figure 5A. The GENESIS trace is also shown for comparison. 

There are some small discrepancies between the results from the NEURON and
GENESIS versions. I believe these are due to numerical differences, but it is 
possible they are due to bugs in my code.
