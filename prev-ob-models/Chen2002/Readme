The autolaunch example produces all figures as well as the fit to the
Shen 1999 data for high and low current stimulus in soma and primary
electrodes. Figures in the paper can also be generated by directly
launching:
	fig3a.hoc
	fig3b.hoc //long computation time unless variable step method used
	fig5a.hoc
	fig5b.hoc
	fig6.hoc
