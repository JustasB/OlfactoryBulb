This model mitral cell (the principal output neuron of the vertebrate 
olfactory bulb) comprises four compartments (soma, apical dendrite, 
apical tuft, lateral dendrite) and exhibits endogenous subthreshold 
oscillations, phase resetting, and evoked spike phasing properties 
as described in mitral cells by:

	oscillations in olfactory bulb output neurons.

Run the model using the file mosinit.hoc after compiling the .mod files.

An xpanel will appear enabling easy recreation of many figures from the 
2006 paper.  Be patient on slower machines as traces will by default only 
become visible after 1600-2000 ms computed time.  Parameters can be derived 
from the xpanel code or from the tables in the 2006 paper.
