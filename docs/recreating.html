<h1>Recreating the Model<a class="headerlink" href="#recreating-the-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The model was created in stages: cell models, network models, odor input, LFP output, simulations, and experiments. While these stages are described in the <a class="reference external" href="https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/223567/content/Birgiolas_asu_0010E_19503.pdf">dissertation</a>, the sections below describe technical details and include links to specific files, tools, and resources. The sections are organized in a chronological order, which can be followed to re-create this or a similar model.</p>
<div class="section" id="mitral-tufted-and-granule-cell-morphologies-cleaned-morphology-metrics-computed-and-representative-morphologies-chosen">
<h2>Mitral, tufted, and granule cell morphologies cleaned, morphology metrics computed, and representative morphologies chosen<a class="headerlink" href="#mitral-tufted-and-granule-cell-morphologies-cleaned-morphology-metrics-computed-and-representative-morphologies-chosen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Morphology Archives</strong></p>
<p>Morphologies for each cell type (mitral, tufted, granule) were obtained from <a class="reference external" href="http://neuromorpho.org/">NeuroMorpho.org</a>, by performing a <a class="reference external" href="http://neuromorpho.org/MetaData.jsp">‘Metadata search’</a> of reconstruction archives. The archives were filtered to include cells with the following parameters: mouse, adult, olfactory bulb region, control condition, and mitral, tufted, or granule cell type.</p>
<p><strong>Inspection and Editing of the SWC Files</strong></p>
<p>Each resulting archive was downloaded and organized into folders which can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/tree/master/morphology-data">[repo]/morphology-data</a>. The 3D renderings of the .SWC files under each archive were manually examined using the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.neutracing.com/">neuTube</a> software. neuTube functions were used to fix simple and obvious flaws (e.g. parts of dendritic trees shifted laterally, or all sections mislabeled as ‘basal’ dendrites). Archives with cells missing important stereotypical features of each cell type were excluded. Besides, neuTube, other <a class="reference external" href="https://neurojustas.com/2019/03/10/tools-for-editing-swc-files-neuron-morphology/">neuronal morphology/SWC editing software</a> was evaluated, but ultimately not used.</p>
<p>Each SWC archive was labeled for whether it was a ‘thin’ (parts of lateral dendrites missing) or ‘full’ (the whole cell was reconstructed) slice. Whether the cells included a soma reconstruction, and whether the reconstructed dendrites included width/radius information (e.g. some archives used constant radius).</p>
<p>The fixed SWC files were saved back into the archive folders and archive categorizations were stored in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/notebooks/morphology.ipynb">[repo]/notebooks/morphology.ipynb Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Computing Reconstructed Cell Population Morphology Metrics</strong></p>
<p>For each reconstruction, NeuroMorpho.org displays a set of whole-cell morphology metrics (e.g. see ‘Measurements’ section of <a class="reference external" href="http://neuromorpho.org/neuron_info.jsp?neuron_name=1-09-TD2b">this reconstruction</a>). For cells in this model, those metrics were computed for soma, apical dendrites, and lateral dendrites of each reconstruction.</p>
<p>The metrics were computed using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/justasb/pylmeasure">pyLMeasure tool</a> (which is a Python wrapper of the <a class="reference external" href="http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/">L-Measure</a> tool). Each metric was formalized as tests of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scidash/neuronunit">NeuronUnit framework</a>. The test definitions have been incorporated into NeuronUnit and can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scidash/neuronunit/blob/dev/neuronunit/tests/morphology.py">[neuronunit]/tests/morphology.py</a></p>
<p>The morphology metrics of each cell were computed using suites of NeuronUnit tests (see: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/notebooks/morphology.ipynb">[repo]/notebooks/morphology.ipynb</a>) and results stored in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/olfactorybulb/model-data.sqlite">the model’s SQLite Database</a> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement</span></code> table. The database tables and records can be viewed online with tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://sqliteonline.com/">SQLite online</a> or offline with an SQLite editor like <a class="reference external" href="http://sqliteexpert.com/">SQLite Expert</a>.</p>
<p>The overall means and standard deviations of each morphology metric were stored in the database in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">property</span></code> table. These overall means and standard deviations were used to select five stereotypical morphologies of each cell type. Reconstructions whose morphology metrics were closest to the cell type population means were selected to be used for cell models in this model. They can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/tree/master/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/SWCs">[repo]/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/SWCs</a>.</p>
<p>The validation of the representativeness of the selected morphologies and comparison with previously published models can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/notebooks/morphology-validation.ipynb">morphology-validation.ipynb notebook</a></p>
<p><strong>Morphology Standardization to Prepare for Network Embedding</strong></p>
<p>To facilitate the embedding of the cell models within reconstructed network layers, the cell morphologies were further edited as follows. The cells were reoriented so that their apical dendrites were aligned with the Z-axis. The natural curvature of lateral dendrites of mitral and tufted cells was planarized so that the lateral dendrites were essentially perpendicular to the apical dendrites. This prepared the lateral dendrites for an algorithm to confine them to the appropriate cell-type-specific laminar regions in the network model. These standardized morphologies can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/tree/master/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/morphology">[repo]/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/morphology</a>.</p>

<h2>Cell electrical properties and behavior identified and characterized<a class="headerlink" href="#cell-electrical-properties-and-behavior-identified-and-characterized" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once cell morphologies were selected, they were turned into active models by inserting ion channel mechanisms. To understand which ion channels should be included, a survey of electrical behaviors of each cell type was conducted via a literature search.</p>
<p><strong>Generic Test and Publication Python Classes</strong></p>
<p>Electrical properties of mitral, tufted, and granule cells from main olfactory bulbs of adult mice were aggregated from literature. These properties included passive (e.g. input resistance and resting voltage) and active membrane properties (e.g. spike half-width, spike accommodation, and inhibitory rebound). The protocols used to measure and compute each property were formalized using a set of NeuronUnit tests. Each publication used slightly different protocols and algorithms to compute the properties (e.g. different slice temperatures, different delays to measure input resistance, different ways to compute action potential threshold). To fairly evaluate how a model reproduces a property, these protocol differences were formalized into the NeuronUnit tests as well. A given property reported in a publication was formalized as a NeuronUnit test that consisted of 1) a generic electrophysiology property Python class (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/olfactorybulb/neuronunit/tests/tests.py#L53">RestingVoltageTest</a>) and 2) publication-specific modifications of the property measurement protocol (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/olfactorybulb/neuronunit/tests/publications.py#L34">BurtonUrban2014</a>).</p>
<p>A NeuronUnit test that computes a property using protocol variations from a specific publication is declared by combining the generic test class with a publication class using Python’s multiple inheritance (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">class</span> <span class="pre">InputResistanceUrbanBurton2014Test(UrbanBurton2014,</span> <span class="pre">InputResistanceTest)</span></code> ). Due to the large number of property and publication combinations, these combined classes were created at run time using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/olfactorybulb/neuronunit/tests/__init__.py#L73">a helper method</a>.</p>
<p>The measurements from each publication are recorded in the SQLite database, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">measurement</span></code> table. The NeuronUnit class to use for each measurement is defined in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">property</span></code> table and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test_class_generic</span></code> column. At run-time, the helper method combined the generic test class with the publication class to create a class that computed the property using the protocol parameters specified in each publication.</p>

<h2>Ion channels placed onto chosen cell morphologies and conductances fitted to experimental distributions<a class="headerlink" href="#ion-channels-placed-onto-chosen-cell-morphologies-and-conductances-fitted-to-experimental-distributions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Previously Published Olfactory Models</strong></p>
<p>A literature search to identify each cell type’s electrical properties revealed a set of ion channels likely responsible for the behavior. Furthermore, a separate literature search was performed to identify previous computational models of each cell type. <a class="reference external" href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/default">ModelDB</a> was utilized to locate runnable NEURON simulator models. Results from the initial search of all olfactory bulb or cell models were manually inspected by following the instructions to run the models and then inspecting which cell types were modeled. If a model included multi-compartment morphologies, the morphology was extracted into .SWC files using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/hoc2swc">hoc2swc</a> tool. The set of previous olfactory models can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/tree/master/prev_ob_models">[repo]/prev_ob_models</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of Ion Channel Models</strong></p>
<p>In addition to morphologies, the previous models included ion channel .MOD files. Many of the .MOD files were nearly identical copies of files from earlier publications. After tracing the publication geneology of each .MOD file, the most recent versions were identified. By examining the reasons why the channels were included, and comparing the electrical behavior seen in experimental literature, channels hypothesized to be responsible for the experimentally observed behaviors were selected for inclusion in this model. If an ion channel model did not include temperature sensitivity, equations to utilize the Q10 coefficient were added to the .MOD file. The ion channel models used in this model can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/tree/master/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/Mechanisms">[repo]/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/Mechanisms</a>.</p>
<p>NEURON Cell Builder feature was used to import morphology SWC files and then insert channel mechanisms. The initial, unoptimized cell models can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/tree/master/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/Cells">[repo]/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/Cells</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Parameter Fitting and Validation</strong></p>
<p>A genetic optimization algorithm was used to identify the combinations of ion channel parameters that best reproduced experimentally observed electrical behaviors (minimized the error between model electrical property values and experimentally observed property means). The algorithm is defined in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/prev_ob_models/Birgiolas2020/fitting.py">fitting.py</a> and Jupyter notebooks used for fitting can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/tree/master/notebooks">[repo]/notebooks</a> (files that start with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fitting</span></code>).</p>

<div class="section" id="olfactory-bulb-layers-were-reconstructed-from-sagittal-and-coronal-slices">
<h2>Olfactory bulb layers were reconstructed from sagittal and coronal slices<a class="headerlink" href="#olfactory-bulb-layers-were-reconstructed-from-sagittal-and-coronal-slices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Bulb Slices and Limitations</strong></p>
<p>To place olfactory bulb cell models in their appropriate anatomical locations, a reconstruction of olfactory bulb layers was necessary.
<a class="reference external" href="https://atlas.brain-map.org/atlas?atlas=1#atlas=1&amp;structure=507&amp;resolution=16.75&amp;x=5536&amp;y=4142&amp;zoom=-4&amp;plate=100960516&amp;z=5">Allen Brain Atlas</a> contains labeled sagital and coronal slices of full adult mouse olfactory bulbs. However, the Allen Atlas API, exposed only partialy reconstructed bulbs (frontal extremes were missing), and did not have labeled cell layer information. But, images of the full bulb slices with layers labeld were available through the <a class="reference external" href="https://atlas.brain-map.org/atlas?atlas=1#atlas=1&amp;structure=507&amp;resolution=16.75&amp;x=5536&amp;y=4142&amp;zoom=-4&amp;plate=100960516&amp;z=5">online viewer</a>. Furthermore, the sagital and coronal slices were different thickness, and the thiner coronal slices did not contain the the frontal bulb extreme region. Thus the coronal slice images were used to reconstruct the 3D shape of the mid and posterior parts of the olfactory bulb at higher resolution, and the thicker sagital slices were used to reconstruct the frontal extreme region.</p>
<p><strong>Conversion of 2D Slices to 3D Layer Meshes</strong></p>
<p>The slice images were downloaded and converted into SVG vector format using <a class="reference external" href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. The SVG files were imported into <a class="reference external" href="http://blender.org/">Blender</a> and positioned apart to match the thickness of the slices. The corresponding points of each neighboring layer were joined together using Blender’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/vertex/make_face_edge.html">Make Face (from edges)</a>. This process was repeated for each layer separately, until the 3D mesh of all the layers of the bulb were reconstructed. The number of polygons of the final mesh were reduced by using Blender’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/decimate.html">Decimate Modifier</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blendernation.com/2018/11/14/blender-2-8-feature-simplify-sculpting-brush/">Dyntopo (dynamic topology) sculpting tool</a>.</p>
<p>The Blender file containing the reconstructed layers can be found under <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/tree/master/blender-files">[repo]/blender-files</a> (bulb-layers.blend and ob-gloms-fast.blend).</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Slices and Generating Potential Positions for Cell Somas within each Layer</strong></p>
<p>To generate positions within each layer where cell somas could be located, the reconstructed layers were filled with approximately evenly distributed points. This was done to enable the use of ‘virtual slices’. A virtual slice can be any 3D shape, but in this model, it was chosen to be a rectangular box. To construct a virtual slice, the slice shape is positioned over a desired part of the reconstructed layers. Any potential-soma points that are located within the parts of the layers that are contained within the virtual slice are selected to be used as potential cell placement locations. Points outside the virtual slice are ignored.</p>
<p>The points for possible cell locations can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JustasB/OlfactoryBulb/blob/master/blender-files/ob-gloms-fast.blend">ob-gloms-fast.blend</a> as Blender’s Particle Systems of reconstructed layer objects ending with “Particles” (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">GL</span> <span class="pre">Particles</span></code> for potential positions for glomeruli, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4</span> <span class="pre">GRL</span> <span class="pre">Particles</span></code> for positions of cells within the granule cell layer). The number of points in each layer was based on the cell and glomeruli count estimates in adult mice bulbs. The points were created using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/blue-noise-particles">Blue Noise Particles</a> addon for Blender.</p>
